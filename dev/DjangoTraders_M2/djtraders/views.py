"""
View functions for the djtraders app.

Browsing (open to anyone): home, customer_list/product_list (search
handled by each model's own search() classmethod, djtraders/models.py),
customer_detail/product_detail, order_detail.

Two logins, each hand-rolled with plain sessions instead of Django's
own auth system: login_view/logout_view (employee, session key
"current_user") and customer_login_view/customer_logout_view (customer,
session key "customer_id"). Only one of the two can be logged in at a
time -- landing on either login page logs out whoever was there before.

Self-service access rule: a logged-in customer may only view/edit their
own record; an employee may act on any customer's. The four helpers at
the top of this file (_own_customer_redirect, _own_employee_redirect,
_customer_edit_denied, _order_access_denied) enforce that rule wherever
it applies, instead of repeating the same session checks in every view.

Customer edit/create: customer_edit_form and customer_edit render the
identical fields two ways -- hand-written <input> tags vs. a Django
ModelForm (CustomerEditForm, djtraders/forms.py) rendered through
django-crispy-forms -- to compare the two approaches side by side.
customer_create reuses customer_edit's own template and form for a
Customer that doesn't exist yet. customer_delete marks a customer
inactive instead of deleting the row.

Ordering: a customer's in-progress order lives in
request.session["cart"] (a plain dict, no database row) until
order_commit writes it out as a real Order plus its OrderDetail rows,
inside one transaction. order_create/order_build/order_add_line/
order_commit walk through that flow; order_delete cancels an
already-placed order on the same day it was placed.
