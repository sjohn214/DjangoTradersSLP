"""
Django Forms for the djtraders app.

A Form (or ModelForm, below) is Django's own way of describing an HTML
form's fields, validation, and rendering as a Python class, instead of
hand-written <input> tags. customer_edit_form.html (the "plain" edit
page) skips this entirely -- it reads request.POST fields directly and
writes them onto the Customer instance itself. CustomerEditForm below
is the same edit, built the ModelForm way instead, rendered by
customer_edit.html through django-crispy-forms' {% crispy %} tag (see
settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS/CRISPY_* settings). Both pages render the
identical field grid on purpose, so the real difference stands out:
CustomerEditForm declares its fields and layout once as a class, and
gets validation Django builds in for free (a required field, a max
length) without any hand-written checks in the view.

CustomerEditForm's fields also carry a running example of Django's
three validation layers, each one enforcing the same rule a different
way:
  - Browser layer (courtesy only): an HTML5 pattern=/required/min=
    attribute on the widget, set in __init__ below. Blocks an obviously
    bad value before a request is even sent -- but proves nothing,
    since disabling JS or editing the request in DevTools skips it
    entirely.
  - Server layer (the real check): a clean_<field>() method (or the
    cross-field clean() on OrderCommitForm below) re-checks the same
    rule and raises ValidationError if it fails. This is the one layer
    that can't be bypassed from the browser.
  - Database layer (final backstop, when there is one): a column
    constraint like max_length that Postgres enforces regardless of
    the two layers above. Some rules (no digits in a company name, a
    required contact name) have no database layer behind them at all --
    the schema simply doesn't express that rule, so the form is the
    only thing enforcing it.
phone (clean_phone), company_name/city (clean_company_name/clean_city,
no-digits), and contact_name (required=True override in __init__) are
four small, independent examples of this pattern -- useful as a
template for writing a new business rule elsewhere in the app.
