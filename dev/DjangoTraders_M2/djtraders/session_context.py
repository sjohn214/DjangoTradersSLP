"""
Template context processors for the djtraders app -- functions Django
runs for every template render, adding whatever they return into every
template's context automatically (see settings.py's TEMPLATES
OPTIONS['context_processors'], where this module is registered).

This file could be named anything -- Django finds a context processor by
the full dotted path given in settings.py (e.g.
"djtraders.session_context.current_employee"), not by filename or
location, unlike models.py/admin.py/apps.py, which Django's app loading
looks for by that exact name. "context_processors.py" is Django's own
common convention for this (django.template.context_processors,
django.contrib.auth.context_processors), but session_context.py names
what these two functions actually do here: read who's logged in back out
of request.session.

current_employee reads "current_user" (an employee_id) back out of
request.session -- set by views.login_view on a successful login -- so
base.html's navbar can show who's logged in without every view having
to look it up and pass it in its own context by hand. current_customer
is the same idea for the customer-facing login, reading "customer_id"
(set by views.customer_login_view). Only one of the two is ever set at
a time, since login_view/customer_login_view each clear both keys on
landing (djtraders/views.py).
