"""
Cleaned-up models generated from `manage.py inspectdb` (see
rev_engineer_models.py for the raw, unedited output). inspectdb reads
an existing database's tables and writes a first-draft model per table,
but leaves manual work behind: every model here is set managed=False
(this app reads a database Django didn't create, so it should never try
to migrate these tables), model names were singularized (Category,
Customer, ...) and reordered so each is defined before anything that
references it by bare class name, and every foreign key was given a
real on_delete (inspectdb defaults to DO_NOTHING) matching what should
actually happen when the related row is removed.

Beyond that baseline, most models add a few computed @property values
(e.g. Order.order_total, Customer.formatted_address) and a couple carry
classmethods used by views.py: *.search() backs a list page's search
form, and Employee.authenticate/Customer.authenticate back this app's
two hand-rolled logins (no django.contrib.auth involved). Each one's
own docstring below explains the specifics.
